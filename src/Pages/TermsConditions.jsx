                  By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the
                  Products from Shop, the Customer agrees that it is bound by
                  these Terms and Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including
                  orders placed via the internet, are subject to acceptance by
                  Shop. The acceptance of the Customer's order by Shop is
                  expressly made conditional upon the Customer's assent to these
                  Terms and Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding
                  anything that may be stated to the contrary on the Customer's
                  order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at
                  any time and any subsequent orders placed by the Customer will
                  constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. Once a
                  Customer order has been placed and accepted by Shop, the
                  Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or
                  vary the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by
                  both parties.

                  acceptance by the Customer within the period stated in the
                  quotation or, where no period is stated, within seven (7) days
                  from the date of the quotation. Thereafter, prices stated in
                  the quotation may be varied by Shop without notice to the

                  that the Products are accepted for delivery within a
                  reasonable time. Prices are subject to change without notice.
                  Recommended retail prices are provided for indicative purposes
                  only and there is no obligation for Shop to comply with that

                  price charged for the goods sold may be amended to take into
                  account any variation in the total quantity purchased by the
                  Customer. Prices include GST, but do not include any other tax
                  or duty, which is in addition to the price and is to be paid
                  by the Customer at the time of payment for the Products.

                  Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information
                  supplied and the representations made by the Customer. In the
                  event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer,
                  whether total or partial, the Customer must immediately
                  provide written notice to Shop informing Shop of these
                  changes. Until Shop receives written notice from the Customer
                  of a change in ownership, the Customer (including where it is
                  a company or trustee, each of the Directors thereof) holds
                  Shop indemnified against any and all losses, unpaid accounts,
                  interest, damages, costs, charges, fees and expenses incurred
                  or suffered by Shop in trading with any person, company
                  (including the same company but with a different shareholder
                  or shareholders) or other entity (including a trust) which may
                  have purchased the Customer's business or any interest in the
                  Customer's business or any of the shares in the Customer and
                  used the Customer's previously approved account for trading.

                  Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments
                  through Credit Card Direct Debit, the Customer must provide
                  notice in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change
                  in ownership of the business to allow Shop sufficient time to
                  contact the new owner to obtain and confirm new Credit Card
                  information if applicable.

                  The means of delivering the Products to the Customer will be

                  Territory Deliveries) or urgent delivery arrangements, these
                  additional costs may be charged to the Customer and may
                  include the cost of airfreight where it is not the normal
                  method of delivery. The Customer agrees to accept delivery of

                  Shop will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from

                  entitle the Customer to rescind or repudiate the Customer's
